# THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS
This is a 3D stylish racing game I made as a final project for "Game Design Studio" at Georgia Tech. The project 
involved designing a game using the strategies and techniques we learned and using Unity (C#) to create it. The project
is a prototype, so while it is fully playable and fairly well polished, it is not a full game and lacks visual fidelity.

The game was designed with the goal of having several strongly intertwined gameplay systems layered on top of each other
and is intended to leave a lot of room for players mastering those systems. The player runs a crazy taxi service where
their customers are just as excited for a joyride as they are getting to their destination on time, so the player has
to balance speed with style while also not crashing. Their goal is to get a high score and they get points based on their
delivery speed, and how many cool tricks they can do without crashing like drifting, jumping, and driving fast. The result 
is that the driving, style scoring, and passenger delivery are all deeply connected making for a mechanically complex
experience.
